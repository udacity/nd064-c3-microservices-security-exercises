# Purpose of This Repo

This repo is meant to be used to keep things organized during content development and act as the source of truth for all exercises related to this course.

## Folder Structure

### Lesson Folder

This repo contains a folder for each `lesson` folder.

Example
```
lesson-1-hello
lesson-2-world
lesson-3-foo
lesson-4-bar
```

Each `lesson` folder is named using the naming convention of `lesson-#-name-of-lesson`.

Example
```
lesson-1-hello
```

Four lesson folders have been provided as a template; However, you may need to add more or possibly use less than four depending on what is needed.

If you require an additional lesson folder, you can make a copy of the folder and paste it into the root directory.

### Exercises Folder

Each `lesson` folder contains an `exercises` folder. This `exercises` folder should contain all files and instructions necessary for the exercises along with the solution. The solutions for these exercises will be shared with students. See the `README` in the `exercises` folder for information about folder structure.
